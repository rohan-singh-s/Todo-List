        A todo list is a simple tool that helps individuals or teams keep track of tasks or activities they need to complete. It is a list of tasks or goals that need to be accomplished, typically written down in a notebook, digital application, or on a piece of paper. Todo lists can be used for personal or professional purposes, and can be organized by priority, deadline, or category. They are a great way to stay organized, increase productivity, and reduce stress by breaking down larger tasks into smaller, manageable steps. By regularly updating and checking off completed tasks, individuals can feel a sense of accomplishment and stay motivated to tackle their goals.
